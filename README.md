# PortfolioProject
Web Dev Portfolio (wip) KEEP 
## User Story

I wanted to make a webpage showcasing my portfolio and my growing skills as a web developer. Since I don't have a portfolio to link to, I have provided a placeholder link. The first thing I focused on for building this portfolio is how I wanted it to look as I knew it would be the first thing that future employers would notice before they saw my builds. I thought of something that would immediately catch someone's eye and would also be familiar to anyone who has used a computer in the last twenty years.

My webpage background is entitled 'The Bliss' taken by Charles O'Rear and has been used as a default screensaver for Microsoft machines for over 20 years. My first obstacle was using this photo to style the entire webpage background without tiling. To do this I switched from using an image that was 1152x576px to an image that was 3140x2160px. When I had done this, the image filled the screen and did not repeat.

After I was able to fix my background image I focused on styling the other elements on the page such as the links to my accounts, the font and layout.

I started with linking to my Github(https://github.com/Are-Jae), Portfolio and LinkedIn(https://www.linkedin.com/in/raven-evans-070117246/) and choosing where I wanted them to be in the webpage. I placed the yellow icon folders on the left side of the webpage and in the header with the links to my profiles placed below them. I plan to embed these links into the image of the yellow folders in order for them to open on another page and create a more dynamic user experience.

I then inserted an image of a Windows Notepad dialogue box in order to write a short summary about myself. I had to center the image in the middle of the webpage and impose a text box over it with my summary. The end result is the text appearing as though it has been typed onto the image.

Once I had added those elements to my webpage my last task was to add an image of myself. As a complete webpage it displays: three yellow file folders on the left side of the page with links to my profiles, an image of myself in the top left of the page and lastly a short bio about myself set inside of a notepad image.

I would like to apply javascript to this webpage in order for it to be easier to navigate and to provide a pleasant user experience for anyone who visits my online portfolio. I'm unable to figure out how to use javascript functions to reveal my bio once the link underneath my pfp image is clicked.

I have my folder icons labeled and aligned how I want. I now need to add pagination so that my portfolio links to a second page instead of redirecting to the current landing page.

## Expected Behavior

The webpage displays as a Windows 95 Desktop background with yellow icon folders embedded with links to my Github, portfolio and LinkedIn accounts. All icons will open in a new tab with the portfolio icon opening another page connected to my landing page with a Notepad image displaying links to my deployed webpages. The icons will have the name of each account listed underneath them (but they will not be hyperlinks). My profile picture will display at the top center of the page above my bio with a caption instructing user to "Click Here" wherein my bio will appear as a Notepad image with a brief introduction to myself.

## Current Behavior

Webpage displays as Windows 95 background with yellow icon folders on the left hand side of screen. There are hyperlinks that will redirect user to my various professional accounts. There is no profile picture, no pagination and no javascript applied to this webpage.
Acceptance Criteria

My webpage is complete when a potential client is able to view my deployed webpage that displays as a Windows 95 desktop background known as "The Bliss" with yellow icon folders that when clicked takes the user to their respective destinations (github, my portfolio, LinkedIn). When a user clicks on the embedded links within my icons they open into new pages. When my portfolio icon is engaged with it opens as a similar webpage to my landing page with links in the notepad image where a future employer is able to view my deployed websites.
